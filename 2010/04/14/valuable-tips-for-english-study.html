    <p><strong>1. Don’t overstudy</strong>. Trying to study too much in <strong>one</strong> session will lower your ability to remember new things. The brain can  only remember so many items at once, and everyone’s brain is different.  For example, some people can remember over 50 new words a week, while  others remember only 3-4. When you feel you’ve had enough, stop and take  a break – give your brain a rest. If you have been studying for many  years, take a break from your studies for a week or two. When you return  to your studies you will find that you can remember much more than  before. Never study more than 3-4 times a week – For example, study <strong>one</strong> <strong>day</strong> and  rest the next.</p>

<p><strong>2. Improve your memory</strong>: The brain is like a muscle.  It needs exercise or it will lose its ability to process and store  information. Set a regular study time for yourself (just like if you  were going to the gym every other <strong>day</strong>) and keep to your  schedule. Your body clock will prepare the brain for study if it becomes  use to this schedule. If you are having trouble remembering, connect  new words with things you (or others) already have or know. (For  example, I have a wall clock, a calendar and a desk at home, but I don’t  have a TV. My sister has a TV, but she doesn’t have a cellphone. – 5  new nouns of real things I already know about in my life.)</p>

<p><strong>3. Repeat new words out loud</strong>, until you are sure of  your pronunciation. If possible, record yourself speaking and then  listen to it, while comparing it to your foreign teacher’s voice. (Ask  your teacher for pronunciation help as often as you need.)</p>

<p><strong>4. Syllable stress</strong>: Break down words into syllables  and remember that each word has only <strong>one</strong> syllable which is  stressed. (For example “Study”, Stú ·dy has two syllables, and the  stress is placed on the syllable “Stú”. – some students find it easier  to write down each syllable and mark the stressed <strong>one</strong> with a Vietnamese  tone marker.) Remember basic rules for stress.</p>

<p><strong>5. Nouns</strong>: Find new vocabulary items in your  environment. Use the foreign vocabulary to talk about them, not your  native language. (Seeing/knowing something real will help improve  learning and memory. – See #2 above.)</p>

<p><strong>6. Verbs</strong>: If your new vocabulary word is a verb, try  to imagine yourself (and others) doing that action. Try making new  sentences using yourself, your friend(s), family, and/or groups of  people using the new verb. (For example: “I swim”, “he swims”, “they  swim”, “we swim” etc.). When you have accomplished that, try to use  three forms of the verb tense. (For example “I eat”, “I ate”, “I have  eaten”.)
<strong>7. Adjectives</strong>: If your new vocabulary word is an  adjective, use your word knowledge to connect with nouns and make  sentences, describing those items. For example: “a shiny black wooden  table”, “a beautiful gold watch”, “an expensive Nokia cellphone”.  Practice this step with #5 above. (Remember that not all adjectives fit  with all nouns.)</p>

<p><strong>8. Grammar</strong>: Remember grammar structure - (subject +  verb + object). Try to remember where certain words go, i.e., adjectives  go before the noun, the verb “to be” goes after the subject, etc.</p>

<p><strong>9. Make notes</strong> in class: Keep a class notebook. The  teacher will usually write a grammar or pronunciation point down on the  board for you. You should keep a record of what each class is about.  Copying the class whiteboard to paper is <strong>one</strong> way to remember exactly  what you studied, and it’s easier to review later.</p>

<p><strong>10. Keep a pocket notebook with you</strong> wherever you go.  When you see something that you haven’t studied yet, write it down (in  your language). When you get home, look-it up in the dictionary (always  use more than <strong>one</strong>) and write the meaning down (in English) next to your  native word. By using these visual and writing skills it will help you  in the learning process and prevent spelling errors.</p>
